= Monitoring Resources

The different montioring resources used are:

- PodMonitors
- PrometheusRules
- GrafanaDashboards (or ConfigMaps in plain k8s)

The source of truth for these resources is in `config/observability/monitoring_resources`.
There is a make target called `gen-monitoring-resources` that takes the contents of that directory and outputs resources in the following locations:

- `config/observability/kubernetes`
- `config/observability/openshift`

The output resources differ slightly to allow working with the different monitoring stack setups in plain kubernetes vs. openshift.
This generation also allows for variable template if you want different values for things like alert thresholds.
There is another make target called `verify-gen-monitoring-resources`, which runs in the CI job to ensure the generated files are up to date.
